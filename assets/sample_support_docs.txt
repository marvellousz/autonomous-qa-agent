AUTONOMOUS QA AGENT - SUPPORT DOCUMENTATION
===========================================

OVERVIEW
--------
The Autonomous QA Agent is an intelligent system designed to answer questions based on ingested documents. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, context-aware responses.

KEY FEATURES
------------
1. Document Ingestion: Supports PDF, HTML, JSON, and plain text files
2. Vector Search: Uses FAISS for efficient similarity search
3. Question Answering: Generates answers using LLM with retrieved context
4. Selenium Script Generation: Creates automation scripts based on descriptions

DOCUMENT FORMATS SUPPORTED
--------------------------
- PDF files (.pdf): Parsed using PyMuPDF (fitz)
- HTML files (.html, .htm): Parsed using unstructured library
- JSON files (.json): Converted to readable text format
- Text files (.txt): Direct text processing

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
------------------
1. Upload Documents:
   - Use the Document Ingestion page to upload your documents
   - Multiple files can be uploaded at once
   - Documents are automatically chunked and indexed

2. Ask Questions:
   - Navigate to Question Answering page
   - Enter your question in natural language
   - The system retrieves relevant context and generates an answer

3. Generate Selenium Scripts:
   - Describe the automation task you want to perform
   - Optionally provide URL and specific actions
   - The system generates a Python Selenium script

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- If documents fail to upload, check file format compatibility
- For LLM errors, ensure your LLM provider (Ollama/Groq) is running
- Vector database issues may require re-indexing documents
